# NBA-League-Analysis
Small scale data analysis of the NBA league (National Basketball Association) using Google Sheets.

## Project Overview

🏀 NBA Season Performance Analysis (Google Sheets). This work serves as a **portfolio piece** highlighting the ability to generate meaningful, data-backed insights using just a single tool, the widely-used spreadsheet software. The analysis uses accessible **Google Sheets** to demonstrate fundamental data analytical skills, including cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.



## Dataset 
This dataset contains detailed statistics for NBA players during the 2023-2024 playoff season. It includes a wide range of metrics that cover various aspects of player performance, including scores, rebounds, assists, turnovers, shooting efficiency, and more.

## Business Questions & Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis was to answer key questions relevant to team performance and player evaluation using a publicly available dataset. A few of the business queries this analysis addresses:

* Which team has the most players in the dataset?
* What is the average Points per Game (PPG), Rebounds per Game (RPG), and Assists per Game (APG) for players in each team?
* Identify players with APG above 5 and PPG above 20.
* Visualize the distribution of players by team and position.
* Analyse the impact of player age on performance metrics (PPG, APG, and RPG).
* Determine the top players in each position (Guard, Forward, Center) based on PPG.


## Key Findings & Insights

1. The teams **Boston (BOS), Minnesota (MIN), and Orlando (ORL)** had the most players (15 each) represented in the dataset.
2. Of all the age groups analyzed, **Age 25** presumes to be the prime, showing the **highest average combined performance metric (PPG + RPG + APG)**.
3. **Indiana** recorded the highest average usage percentage (USG%), while **Boston** had the lowest average USG%, suggesting different offensive philosophies.
4. The analysis identified **12 players** who met the high-bar criteria of APG > 5 and PPG > 20, demonstrating a balance of scoring and distribution.
5. **Nikola Jokic** was identified as the overall top player, recording the highest combined performance metrics across the board.
6. A series of visualizations (bar graphs, scatter plots) were used to display:    
       - Player distribution by team and position.    
       - Comparison of average PPG, APG, and RPG across all teams.    
       - The relationship between PPG and Minutes per Game (MPG).
